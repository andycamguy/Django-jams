# What am I doing?
Description
Create a music library database/API with Django using this template(Docker) as a base for a local project. Gitpod Template

 as the backend for an application like Spotify or Apple Music.
Ports served: 
 - PostgresQL DB: 5432 (automatic)
 - Django server: 8000 (when running  manage.py runserver )
